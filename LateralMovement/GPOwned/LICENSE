Hello World!

I don't know why, but in the last few months several users have contacted me in different ways asking for information about the licence that applies to this repo or suggesting me to add one.

I'm very surprised because this repo was just a crappy script I made in an afternoon to test a couple of things in my lab (and that I later reused some times at work). So I don't really understand how people use it.

You have total freedom with this script. Copy, modify, or whatever you want to do with it. Just follow two rules:
- If you use it in a blog or an article, add a link to https://github.com/X-C3LL/GPOwned
- Don't remove the author name (@TheXC3LL)


Have a nice day!
